# Sal's Shipping
### Sal's Shipping program using Python.

Sal's Shipping program using Python asks the user for the weight of their package and then tells them which method of shipping is cheapest and how much it will cost to ship their package using Sal’s Shippers.


Sal wants to make sure that every single one of his customers has the best, and most affordable experience shipping their packages. In this project, I’ll build a program that will take the weight of a package and determine the cheapest way to ship that package using Sal’s Shippers.
